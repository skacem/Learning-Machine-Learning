# Session 2 - Introduction to Linear Regression

One of the most common goal in statistics is to find associations between different variables in a dataset, and to understand their relationships and check if it is possible to use some of the variables to predict others. Regression analysis does just that by finding the line and corresponding equation that provides the best fit to our dataset. Indeed, we use regression for two primary goals:

1. To understand the relationships between these variables. How do changes in the independent variables relate to changes in the dependent variable?
2. To predict the dependent variable by entering values for the independent variables into the regression equation.

In this session we are going to introduce some of the core theoretical basics of linear regression, including multivariate and categorical regression and later on apply the theory on standard data sets using python modules such as `scikit-learn` and `statsmodels`.
