# Session 2 - Introduction to Linear Regression

One of the most common goal in statistics is to find associations between different variables in a dataset, and to understand their relationships and check if it is possible to use some of the variables to predict others. Regression analysis does just that by finding the line and corresponding equation that provides the best fit to our dataset.

In this session we are going to introduce some of the core theoretical basics of linear regression, including multivariate and categorical regression and later on apply the theory on standard data sets using python modules such as `scikit-learn` and `statsmodels`.
