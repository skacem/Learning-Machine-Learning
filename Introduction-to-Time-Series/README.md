# Introduction to Time Series Analysis

## Motivation

Time series analysis is the process of extracting insightful summary and statistical information from chronologically arranged data. It's primary objective is to develop mathematical models that provide plausible descriptions for a given sample data. This enables both: past events to be assessed and future behavior to be forecasted. 

Time series are basically everywhere and organizations are sitting on a treasure trove of such data. In fact, the temporal element itself is not a prerequisite for a time series analysis - as long as there is an unambiguous and meaningful arrangement of the x-axis, with a concrete meaning of the distance along this axis. Those companies who know how to exploit this kind of information, will have a clear competitive advantage. Despite this necessity, companies often lack the resources needed to process at scale all the time series data at their disposal. 

In this repo, we will introduce Python for time series analysis. This is by no means a complete guide to the time series tools available in Python, but instead is intended as a broad overview of how you as a user should approach working with time series. A more elaborate approach with explanations of the theory behind forecasting and machine learning models can be fing under my other repos [Practical-Time-Series-Analysis](https://bit.ly/3p1MXzd)
